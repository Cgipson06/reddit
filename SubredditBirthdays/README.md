Subreddit Birthdays
==========

Gathering some information on the creation dates of subreddits, so you don't have to.

Once a subreddit is added to the list, it will never be re-queried. Subreddits which have become private or have changed their nsfw status will not be properly reflected here.

The earliest subreddit after which IDs are consistently incrementing is [/r/jedbergtest](http://reddit.com/r/jedbergtest) at 2qh0f. This means there are upwards of 628,061 subreddits to collect.
