Schedulizer
========

Schedulize your posts! Tell this bot what to post, where to post it, and, most importantly, *when* to post it.

When you run scheduleclient.py, it will open a console window as well. This console will tell you when you've done something incorrectly, and when your post has successfully been saved (you can then view the post in the "Upcoming" tab). I'm sure you'd just love it if the GUI window told you this kind of stuff, but we can't all have what we want, okay?

The Client does not connect to reddit, meaning it's not going to know if you've spelled a subreddit incorrectly, or if the subreddit is private. That's for you to know and the bot to find out during runtime.

In order for the posts to actually get made, you have to leave schedulebot.py running. You may open and close scheduleclient.py as much as you wish. You may use the client while the bot is off.
