RankFlair
=========


Assigns flair to posts based on their rank in a subreddit's top-of-all-time listing (ex: /r/botwatch/top/?sort=top&t=all)[http://reddit.com/r/botwatch/top/?sort=top&t=all]

A post's flair can increase in rank as the post moves upward, but it will never decrease - A post will keep the highest ranking flair it has ever achieved.
