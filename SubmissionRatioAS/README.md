SubmissionRatio -- Flaired users only
===

This modified version of SR will only log data of users whose flair is non-empty. All punishments have been removed.

The data is published to a subreddit [wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoldTesting/wiki/batman).

You may use AddUser.py to scan a user's profile for material in your subreddit to augment what the bot was able to collect. This is subject to the same 1k limits as usual, but may pick up the scraps.

You may use ChangeUser.py to manually enter a user's information, but you need to run AddUser on him first.

You should download my wiki.txt file as a starting point, and modify it if you're feeling brave. Compare the contents of wiki.txt to [this page](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoldTesting/wiki/batman) to understand how they match up.
