Is there a way to download or copy an entire post/thread?

[There was a thread made for this a year ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/
help/comments/1aiyoa/is_there_a_way_to_download_or_easily_extract/),
but it was never really answered. I have Notepad++ if anyone can
explain /u/andytuba's idea. I'm illiterate when it comes to
programming.

What is the end-product supposed to look like?  /u/andytuba was saying
that you could get the comments' data through the reddit API and then
put all the text into a file. The biggest question is how you want it
formatted. I'll write something up for you if you like.  Also, you can
ctrl+s in browser, and then just load that html file if you want to
re-read the thread later.

    Normal reddit format would be ideal, but if that's not achievable
    just :
    
     &lt;Comment
    
                    &lt;All Child Comments
    
                                      &lt;All Child Comments
    
                                                           &lt;etc.
    
                                            Though, I'm not sure I gave
    the sort of answer you were looking for.
    
    *edit not sure why text is blue, but that'll do.

        [Here is some output](https://github.com/voussoir/reddit/blob/
        master/ThreadReader/t3_2kdpba.txt) based on [this thread](http://www.r
        eddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2kdpba/whats_not_supposed_to_be_scary_b
        ut_actually_is/), and [another](https://github.com/voussoir/reddit/blo
        b/master/ThreadReader/t3_2k44u4.txt) from here. I'd say it's not
        perfect, but it's actually much better than I was expecting.
        
        To use it, follow steps 1-8 of [this tutorial](http://www.reddit.com/r
        /GoldTesting/comments/26r2ob/how_to_install_and_use_a_python_reddit_bo
        t/) to install Python and PRAW.
        
        Then, copy everything from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vo
        ussoir/reddit/master/ThreadReader/threadreader.py), paste it into
        notepad. Put your username between the quotes on line 8, and save it
        as `threadreader.py`.
        
        Finally, double click to run, and it will ask you for the thread ID.
        This is the 6-character string in the post url. Yours is 2k44u4. It
        will create txt files in the same folder as the .py file, so you might
        want to create a folder for it.
