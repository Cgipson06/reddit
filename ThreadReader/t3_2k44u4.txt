Is there a way to download or copy an entire post/thread?

[There was a thread made for this a year ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/
help/comments/1aiyoa/is_there_a_way_to_download_or_easily_extract/),
but it was never really answered. I have Notepad++ if anyone can
explain /u/andytuba's idea. I'm illiterate when it comes to
programming.

What is the end-product supposed to look like? /u/andytuba was saying
that you could get the comments' data through the reddit API and then
put all the text into a file. The biggest question is how you want it
formatted. I'll write something up for you if you like. Also, you can
ctrl+s in browser, and then just load that html file if you want to
re-read the thread later.

    Normal reddit format would be ideal, but if that's not achievable
    just :
    
     &lt;Comment
    
                    &lt;All Child Comments
    
                                      &lt;All Child Comments
    
                                                           &lt;etc.
    
                                            Though, I'm not sure I gave
    the sort of answer you were looking for.
    *edit not sure why text is blue, but that'll do.
