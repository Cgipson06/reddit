Driving next to a semi truck. Especially between a concrete barrier
and a semi truck.
 
    /u/Fiji_Artesian, clkbrzu, Oct 26 2014 17:47:20 UTC
    During the rain when all that spray is coming off the semi truck
    tires blinding your windshield.
 
        /u/psinguine, clkevw5, Oct 26 2014 19:19:39 UTC
        Rain-X. I use it for exactly this reason. You give your window
        a cursory wash, dry it, then apply the Rain-X fluid. Let it go smokey
        and then wipe it off. Just like that your windshield becomes a super
        hydrophobic surface. It works even better when combined with the whole
        system, Rain-X wipers and washer fluid. It really does work just as
        well as they claim and it takes no more than like 10-20 minutes.
        As an added bonus your wipers last a long time because you rarely use
        them. AND when you're driving in the rain it's like the starscape
        screensaver on old computers!
 
            /u/Fiji_Artesian, clkexsf, Oct 26 2014 19:21:17 UTC
            You had me at *starscape screensaver*.
            Actually you had me before that but saying you had me at *Rain-x*
            wasn't as funny.

    /u/DanTheTerrible, clkdrvo, Oct 26 2014 18:45:45 UTC
    Driving next to a semi can actually be pretty dangerous.  These
    guys are professionals and can be relied on not to cause accidents IF
    THEY CAN SEE YOU.  But the length of the vehicle and lack of windows
    in the trailer cause large blind spots.  A good rule is if you can't
    see the driver in his mirror, he can't see you, move.

    Hello I35!
 
    /u/ScarFaceBitch, clkekwq, Oct 26 2014 19:10:16 UTC
    I become severely anxious when driving next to or near semi-
    trucks. I have an irrational fear of being run off the road or crushed
    under one.
 
    /u/LennyNero, clkcm13, Oct 26 2014 18:10:53 UTC
    I don't understand why people find this scary.
    Truck drivers are professionals, drive FAR FAR FAR more miles than you
    ever will (up to 2500 miles per week), have to take yearly medical
    tests, are often company trained as well as having their commercial
    drivers' licenses, are required to take rest periods, and have FAR
    fewer accidents than cars/light trucks.
    Most professional drivers I know take their job very seriously and try
    to do their best to keep safe on the roads.
 
        /u/leangoatbutter, clkd2fz, Oct 26 2014 18:24:21 UTC
        It's not necessarily the truck/driver that can be scary. In my
        experience it is the draft that it can cause and when it's slick and
        there is little visibility it can cause accidents. One night I crashed
        into barrier on highway due to these circumstances. The semi driver
        wasn't to blame. But the vehicle helped create the set of
        circumstances that caused the accident.
        
 
        /u/Moonlight_Wisteria, clkd6g9, Oct 26 2014 18:27:51 UTC
        Truck drivers are also often on the road for huge stretches of
        time, and have not had adequate sleep. That makes them statistically
        dangerous drivers. Also, in my personal experience I've seen some
        intensely horrifying driving from semi truckers, especially late at
        night. Finally, the huge size and overwhelming momentum of a semi
        truck makes the accident a lot more likely to be catastrophic for my
        tiny sedan.
        I did some quick figuring, and I think you've got ~.37% chance of
        dying in any given motor vehicle crash, as compared to ~1.8% chance of
        dying in a crash involving a large truck. Feel free to check my
        figures, if you're interested: http://www-

    They also really suck at driving 90% of the time.
 
        /u/mmkaykids, clkbawo, Oct 26 2014 17:33:01 UTC
        Probably because they're awake 90% of the time.
 
            /u/boobiesandbooze, clkbfg6, Oct 26 2014 17:36:55 UTC
            Probably because they're ~~awake~~ asleep 90% of the time.
            ok...I don't know why i'm being downvoted. its well known that truck
            drivers are usually very tired and a lot of accidents happen because
            they're usually drowsy or sometimes asleep.
 
                /u/mmkaykids, clkbgvy, Oct 26 2014 17:38:08 UTC
                I'm talking about how they're always so sleep

        They are some of the most skilled drivers on the road.
 
            /u/EverGoodHunterMe, clkcdqf, Oct 26 2014 18:04:16 UTC
            Imagine the average driver sitting behind the wheel of one
            of those things. Especially trying to back it up.
 
        /u/santogue, clkch0a, Oct 26 2014 18:06:46 UTC
        HA. Ok, go get in a semi, back up and hook up your trailer
        full of thousands of dollars in goods, then pull out onto the road
        full of everything from distracted texting teens to deaf/senile old
        people, and stay there without killing anyone until you reach your
        destination 100-several thousand miles away. When you're still stuck
        at the warehouse trying to back up the truck to the trailer you may
        rethink how bad these guys are at driving...

    When I was a kid my granny got me one of those motherfucking
    terrifying porcelain dolls, and I spent every night worrying that when
    I woke up its fucking evil face would be pointed toward me even though
    I always faced it toward the wall so it couldn't watch me sleep.

    I don't like clowns or dolls.
    My Grandma had a creepy clown doll that is gone now but no matter what
    she did, the head of the clown would always fall and tilt to the right
    which was acing the bed I would be sleeping in.
    One night (although I don't remember it), I apparently woke up crying
    with the doll on the floor and I told my Grandma the clown came to
    life and fell off the dresser. I don't remember it but I would love to
    have remembered it to see it. It probably didn't come to life and
    something made it fall off the dresser some how.

            The whole concept of driving is somewhat terrifying to me.
            Like you're trusting everyone else on the road to pilot thousand-pound
            autmobiles at 60+ mph and observe all of the rules that keep you from
            dying. Like, have you MET people?

        Imagine what it might feel like to be in fear for your life just
        because your sitting in a passenger seat. It sucks so incredibly bad.
        It's mentally and physically exhausting. I avoid it as much as
        possible. I have to rearrange my whole life to figure out ways to not
        be a passenger. That takes a lot of effort and causes lots of missed
        opportunities. And I also have to worry about how bad I feel for
        scaring/irritating the driver. To top it off, there is nothing I can
        do about all of this! Nothing! I just have to live with it, and so
        does everyone else.

    because she doesn't know what's on the other side/has issues with

    least hear if someone's coming in/have some protection against someone
    seeing what I'm doing.
    It wasn't until we started living together that I realized there is no
    good solution to this problem. Both of our methods leave us vulnerable
    in some way and paranoia means anything can happen. All is scary.

Sleeping without a blanket. It's that thing you do when you're a kid
where you hide under the blanket that just sticks. You don't
necessarily have to hide under it now, but you just need to have a
blanket with/on you.

Sleeping in bed with your head facing the door.  I bet most of you
sleep with your feet towards the door, because your subconscious. is
telling you to be ready for an attack by the boogeymen.

Some kids films. Honestly I don't know how they get away with it
sometimes.  Monsters inc for instance isn't scary if you think about
it, but my son developed a fear of sleeping on his own after the film
because he was scared of that lizardy guy who disappears.  It is kinda
fucked up if you think about it. A kids film about monsters that come
out of your closet at night and compete on who can scare the most.

    Age category is pretty important. Its probably mostly meant for
    kids around 8 - 10

From what I understand I would say getting an MRI. I've had a few and
never had an issue. But,  I know a *ton* of people that have had all
sorts of claustrophobic issues/meltdowns.
 
    /u/landshrk83, clkd1pe, Oct 26 2014 18:23:45 UTC
    I've always found them really relaxing.  I had to have a scan that
    lasted about 45 minutes last year and ended up getting a 30 min nap.
 
        /u/oldhead, clkd84w, Oct 26 2014 18:29:16 UTC
        Yeah, I just lay there and chill. But I know others hate it.
 
    /u/implodemode, clkeq9m, Oct 26 2014 19:14:53 UTC
    I'm somewhat claustrophobic but as long as I keep my eyes closed
    during an MRI, I'm okay. They have fresh air blowing through so you
    don't feel enclosed. I have a strong urge to freak out but I don't
    because then the ordeal will just take longer. I make myself day dream
    of something pleasant. I think the last time I managed to fall asleep.
    And I felt really good afterward because the MRI warmed up the
    affected area.

My own mind. Sometimes I just get random thoughts like "How would I
murder this person?" or "What would happen if I bit her ear off?"
Random violence towards strangers is not something I plan to do, but
my brain makes plans anyway whe I'm not looking.
 
    /u/RebeccaOTool, clkdrux, Oct 26 2014 18:45:45 UTC
    That's actually really common. It's got a name 'call of the void'
    or something similar. Most people have those thoughts.

I dislike being high. I haven't tried many drugs because of this but a
drag too much weed, or a perc will put me in a place where I freak out
because my brain feels out of control. It has taken me years (about 5)
to tolerate the amount of codeine in 2 tylenol 3's (except I can't
handle the tylenol)

    I dated a girl that collected clown dolls.  I always told her they
    were creepy.  Year later we reconnected on FB.  I asked her about the
    dolls.  She said she got rid of them because they were creepy.

Lying down on bed unable to sleep when you get sleep paralysis.
 
    /u/rainbow_zombies, clkauan, Oct 26 2014 17:18:43 UTC
    While having sleep paralysis I've heard drilling, but that is not
    even the creepiest experience I've had. One night I heard whispers and
    i could see shadows moving across my room.
 
    /u/IpsoKinetikon, clkbdiw, Oct 26 2014 17:35:19 UTC
    I used to be terrified of sleep paralysis, but I eventually found
    out it can help you have a lucid dream.
 
    /u/stonedbiscuit, clkd8a9, Oct 26 2014 18:29:22 UTC
    Sleep paralysis is fucking terrifying. I only had one experience
    but I remember the sensation that came over me right before it
    happened so if I feel that I move instantly. I saw slenderman standing
    at the edge of my bed then walk over by my face and bend over and look
    right into my soul.........no fuck that.
