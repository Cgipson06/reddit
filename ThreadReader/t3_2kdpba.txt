Driving next to a semi truck. Especially between a concrete barrier
and a semi truck.
 
    /u/Fiji_Artesian, clkbrzu, Oct 26 2014 17:47:20 UTC
    During the rain when all that spray is coming off the semi truck
    tires blinding your windshield.
 
        /u/psinguine, clkevw5, Oct 26 2014 19:19:39 UTC
        Rain-X. I use it for exactly this reason. You give your window
        a cursory wash, dry it, then apply the Rain-X fluid. Let it go smokey
        and then wipe it off. Just like that your windshield becomes a super
        hydrophobic surface. It works even better when combined with the whole
        system, Rain-X wipers and washer fluid. It really does work just as
        well as they claim and it takes no more than like 10-20 minutes.
        
        As an added bonus your wipers last a long time because you rarely use
        them. AND when you're driving in the rain it's like the starscape
        screensaver on old computers!
 
            /u/Fiji_Artesian, clkexsf, Oct 26 2014 19:21:17 UTC
            You had me at *starscape screensaver*.
            
            Actually you had me before that but saying you had me at *Rain-x*
            wasn't as funny.

    Driving next to a semi can actually be pretty dangerous.  These
    guys are professionals and can be relied on not to cause accidents IF
    THEY CAN SEE YOU.  But the length of the vehicle and lack of windows
    in the trailer cause large blind spots.  A good rule is if you can't
    see the driver in his mirror, he can't see you, move.

    Hello I35!
 
    /u/LennyNero, clkcm13, Oct 26 2014 18:10:53 UTC
    I don't understand why people find this scary.
    
    Truck drivers are professionals, drive FAR FAR FAR more miles than you
    ever will (up to 2500 miles per week), have to take yearly medical
    tests, are often company trained as well as having their commercial
    drivers' licenses, are required to take rest periods, and have FAR
    fewer accidents than cars/light trucks.
    
    Most professional drivers I know take their job very seriously and try
    to do their best to keep safe on the roads.
 
        /u/Moonlight_Wisteria, clkd6g9, Oct 26 2014 18:27:51 UTC
        Truck drivers are also often on the road for huge stretches of
        time, and have not had adequate sleep. That makes them statistically
        dangerous drivers. Also, in my personal experience I've seen some
        intensely horrifying driving from semi truckers, especially late at
        night. Finally, the huge size and overwhelming momentum of a semi
        truck makes the accident a lot more likely to be catastrophic for my
        tiny sedan.
        
        I did some quick figuring, and I think you've got ~.37% chance of
        dying in any given motor vehicle crash, as compared to ~1.8% chance of
        dying in a crash involving a large truck. Feel free to check my
        figures, if you're interested: http://www-
        nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811856.pdf
 
        /u/leangoatbutter, clkd2fz, Oct 26 2014 18:24:21 UTC
        It's not necessarily the truck/driver that can be scary. In my
        experience it is the draft that it can cause and when it's slick and
        there is little visibility it can cause accidents. One night I crashed
        into barrier on highway due to these circumstances. The semi driver
        wasn't to blame. But the vehicle helped create the set of
        circumstances that caused the accident.
        
 
        /u/TeddyBear_Squabble, clkfapd, Oct 26 2014 19:32:14 UTC
        I've never been too scared of them but a couple of months ago
        on a 2 lane highway I had a truck drift into my lane and almost hit
        me. I had to swerve and almost crashed. Now if I have to pass them I
        fucking gun it.
 
        /u/Brick_Hardstone, clkfhg3, Oct 26 2014 19:38:05 UTC
        Not true.  Here in Ontario [the government recently had to
        crack down on the trucker certification schools](http://www.thestar.co
        m/news/gta/2014/10/14/provincial_crackdown_needed_on_truck_driver_trai
        ning_critics_say.html), which are unregulated and churn out licenses
        to anyone who pays for them.
        
        Then add the fact that long hours on the road mean they're usually
        driving on very little sleep and you have yourself a fine recipe for
        disaster.  A fear of being surrounded by tractor trailer is well-
        founded.
 
        /u/rudie2rt, clkfjqh, Oct 26 2014 19:40:04 UTC
        The few that don't take it seriously is what scares me. I've
        had a semi truck decide to tailgate me, a new driver, in a tiny car. I
        was doing nothing wrong. Multiple experiences with the few truck
        drivers who don't take the safety of other drivers seriously has made
        me more than cautious around any semi truck.
 
    /u/ScarFaceBitch, clkekwq, Oct 26 2014 19:10:16 UTC
    I become severely anxious when driving next to or near semi-
    trucks. I have an irrational fear of being run off the road or crushed
    under one.
 
    /u/TheMusketPrince, clkb2gh, Oct 26 2014 17:25:45 UTC
    They also really suck at driving 90% of the time.
 
        /u/mmkaykids, clkbawo, Oct 26 2014 17:33:01 UTC
        Probably because they're awake 90% of the time.

            ok...I don't know why i'm being downvoted. its well known that truck
            drivers are usually very tired and a lot of accidents happen because
            they're usually drowsy or sometimes asleep.

        They are some of the most skilled drivers on the road.

            Imagine the average driver sitting behind the wheel of one
            of those things. Especially trying to back it up.
 
        /u/santogue, clkch0a, Oct 26 2014 18:06:46 UTC
        HA. Ok, go get in a semi, back up and hook up your trailer
        full of thousands of dollars in goods, then pull out onto the road
        full of everything from distracted texting teens to deaf/senile old
        people, and stay there without killing anyone until you reach your
        destination 100-several thousand miles away. When you're still stuck
        at the warehouse trying to back up the truck to the trailer you may
        rethink how bad these guys are at driving...

Childrens dolls
 
    /u/qaboutp, clkc0cv, Oct 26 2014 17:54:09 UTC
    When I was a kid my granny got me one of those motherfucking
    terrifying porcelain dolls, and I spent every night worrying that when
    I woke up its fucking evil face would be pointed toward me even though
    I always faced it toward the wall so it couldn't watch me sleep.
 
        /u/psinguine, clkfb8a, Oct 26 2014 19:32:43 UTC
        When I bought my grandparent's house they left behind my
        grandmother's porcelain doll collection. They sat in her room, blinds
        drawn and lightbulb broken, for months before I could gather enough
        courage to actually enter the room. When I did I opened the blinds and
        changed the lights and put all those god forsaken dolls in a box.
        
        As I was sealing the box I heard a muffled voice. I stopped what I was
        doing, listening to the suddenly quiet house. There was nothing, not
        even a drip of a faucet or a creak of the floor. I carried on boxing
        and again heard a voice. I stopped, heart rate spiked and breathing
        intensified, and listened again. Muffled, as though from far away, I
        could hear a child's voice singing.
        
        Trembling, and I'm not ashamed to admit it, I knelt down and put my
        ear to the box. A child's voice was coming from inside. And it was
        singing.
        
        *mary had a little doll*
        *little doll*
        *little doll*
        *mary had a little doll*
        *it's hair was white as snow*
        *and everywhere that mary went*
        *mary went*
        *mary went*
        *and everywhere that mary went*
        *the doll was sure to go*
        
        I shat a fucking brick wall. The box went out to an old trailer on the
        property, underneath two other boxes, boxed in by boxes, and the door
        was locked by knob and padlock. The doll was still singing as I locked
        it up.
        
        About a week later I got the chance to ask my Grandmother about it.
        She said that one of the dolls was a Singing Doll that was worth a
        fair bit of money. When I had a chance she was wondering if I could
        get it for her. She didn't seem the least bit concerned that I had
        nearly died of heart failure, and didn't see why I felt I should have
        had some advance warning.
        
        I've been there for two years now. The dolls are still locked up in
        that trailer.

            &gt; As I was sealing the box I heard a muffled voice.
            
            If this was that Goosebumps choose your own adventure book, option (a)
            would be your option to put your ear to the box, and option (b) would
            be to fucking scream bloody mutherfucking murder and run the fuck out
            of that house after setting that box of dolls on fire. I'd go with
            option b.

    I don't like clowns or dolls.
    
    My Grandma had a creepy clown doll that is gone now but no matter what
    she did, the head of the clown would always fall and tilt to the right
    which was acing the bed I would be sleeping in.
    
    One night (although I don't remember it), I apparently woke up crying
    with the doll on the floor and I told my Grandma the clown came to
    life and fell off the dresser. I don't remember it but I would love to
    have remembered it to see it. It probably didn't come to life and
    something made it fall off the dresser some how.

    Oh man. My girlfriend insists on doing this. Her rationale is that
    closed doors freak her out (in general, not just while sleeping)
    because she doesn't know what's on the other side/has issues with
    feeling trapped. While I prefer doors closed because then I can at
    least hear if someone's coming in/have some protection against someone
    seeing what I'm doing.
    
    It wasn't until we started living together that I realized there is no
    good solution to this problem. Both of our methods leave us vulnerable
    in some way and paranoia means anything can happen. All is scary.

Mountain Goats.  Black bears get all the negative press but they

around and have horns. I'm especially terrified when one has a kid
around. What if he thinks I'm going to attack his young?  And yes,
mountain goats *do* kill. A hiker in Olympic National Park was gored
to death a few years ago.

Some kids films. Honestly I don't know how they get away with it
sometimes.  Monsters inc for instance isn't scary if you think about
it, but my son developed a fear of sleeping on his own after the film
because he was scared of that lizardy guy who disappears.   It is
kinda fucked up if you think about it. A kids film about monsters that
come out of your closet at night and compete on who can scare the
most.

    I'm somewhat claustrophobic but as long as I keep my eyes closed
    during an MRI, I'm okay. They have fresh air blowing through so you
    don't feel enclosed. I have a strong urge to freak out but I don't
    because then the ordeal will just take longer. I make myself day dream
    of something pleasant. I think the last time I managed to fall asleep.
    And I felt really good afterward because the MRI warmed up the
    affected area.

Success.  Or at least, in leaps.  It's one thing to work really hard
and get a promotion to section manager.  It's one thing to get moved
into a certain department with a raise and more responsibilities.
It's entirely another to start your own artist management agency just
for shits and giggles and a week later have a band from another
country AND your friend's already established band hit you up and ask
for management.  Then you just kind of start to freak out.  This has
been the story of my life everywhere I go.  I'm not complaining.  I'm
happy I'm becoming successful (key word: becoming).  But it's
terrifying because all of the sudden it goes from "oh yeah, I can hook
you up with some good shows and some quality song recordings" to
"fuck, these guys are on a label.  Do I really have anything to offer
them?"  I actually turned down my friend's band because I didn't have
the means to help them.  They would've helped me, if anything.  But
like I said, this happens to me everywhere.  I get hired somewhere,
three months later "Oh, you need to cover the section because the top
dog isn't here."  I took a job at a studio: "oh, our 2nd-in-charge
sound guy is in the hospital, you need to go DJ the fair (which, by
the way, is one of our top contracts)."  I already mentioned the
management agency.  I volunteer at a church as a sound guy, "Oh,
you're the head of the AV department now" or when I volunteered to be
a leader at the youth group "oh, you're in charge of the middle school
group."  I dunno, maybe I'm complaining when I shouldn't be, but it's
just fucking terrifying every time it happens.  I got label offer once
for my own music and I literally had a panic attack like "oh fuck.  Am
I ready for this?  Do I really want this?  Can I do this?"  It's just
too much success too fast is terrifying, even if it's not really much
in the grand scheme of things.  Not one of the things I mentioned will
actually have any kind of repercussions outside of my own life and
maybe a few of the people around me.  But it's weird cause then
everyone else is like "oh, that's so cool!  Go you!  Good job" and I'm
just like "great.  If anyone needs me, I'll be hiding under the bed
because the world is a scary scary place and I'm not sure I have what
it takes."
