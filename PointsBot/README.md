PointsBot
=========

By saying a certain keyword, a user may give a "point" to the person who he replied to. Points are stored as flair. Here are some of the things the config can do:

- Allow any user to distribute points, or only the OP of the thread

- Allow only a certain number of points to be distributed in a single thread

- Put users on an "exempt" list. Exempt users will not receive points. This is useful if they have special flair and you don't want to disrupt it

There is a new version of pointsbot which keeps a leaderboard in your sidebar and on a wiki page.
