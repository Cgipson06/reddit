Stylist
==========

Set your subreddit's stylesheet based on the time of day!

Each of your stylesheets should be saved as a .txt file in the same directory as this bot. You configure the times with the TIMES variable.

Times refer to the UTC timezone, must be zero-padded, and must be in 24h mode. See examples.

You can add or remove as many schedules as you want. You must restart the bot for it to notice new .txt files or changes to the schedule.
